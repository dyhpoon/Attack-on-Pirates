ABOUT
=====

This is a mobile game called "Attack on Pirates" which I wrote from June 2013 to Aug 2013. 

This game is free download and will be available in app store very soon.

Meanwhile, you can check out some code of this game in this repository.

Note that some codes, images and audio are not disclosed as they are copyrighted.

However, you can get a glimpse of the gameplay by downloading the **sample.apk** to your Android devices.

Also, you can check out the game trailer in the following:
