About
============
This is a mobile game which I wrote in my spare time when I was still studying in university. Since this project is no longer maintained, I apologize for any bugs or crashes if you encounter.

Unfortunately, this game has already removed from the app store, but you can still get a glimpse of the gameplay by downloading this [apk](sample.apk) to your Android devices.

Thanks
============
I want to thank the team of *Coffee Games* for their support.
