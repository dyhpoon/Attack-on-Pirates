=====

This is a mobile game called "Attack on Pirates" which I wrote from June 2013 to Aug 2013. Since the project is no longer maintained, I apologize for any bugs or crashes if you encounter.

Even though the game is removed from google play store, you can still get a glimpse of the gameplay by downloading the [sample.apk](https://github.com/dyhpoon/game-project/raw/master/sample.apk) to your Android devices.

For IOS devices, you may download it from [here](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id694119830?__hstc=45742459.06a3d292ea56317626fd4b34bd54fa7e.1414803709737.1414803709737.1414803709737.1&__hssc=45742459.9.1414803709738&__hsfp=2925986181).
